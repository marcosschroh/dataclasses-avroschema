# This script runs pytest benchmarks to compare benchmark results.
#
# The script compares the latest benchmark with the current code.
# This is useful for identifying performance regressions or improvements.
# It should run on a PR, to compare the performance of the current code with the previous release.
#
# Usage: Run this script locally for testing performance changes.
# If you are running on a Mac, you may need to run the bench-current on the previous code,
# and then on the current code.
